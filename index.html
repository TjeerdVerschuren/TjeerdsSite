    <p><br><b>Hello there! I'm Tjeerd :)</b><br>
<br>I'm a student at the University of Twente, currently 21 years old and also work at the DesignLab as a DreamTeamer! My hobbies include playing the guitar, being a scout's leader and mess around with all sorts of creative projects!
<br> <br>After finishing my bachelor's Creative Technology, I'd like to do the master's Educatie in de BÃ¨tawetenschappen to become a teacher in Research and Design (O&O in Dutch).
