<b>My review on other video's / 5 - 11 - 2021</b><br>
This week, all the groups finished their interactive video's and posted them on their website. For this exercise, we had to watch
a few of them and give our opinion on them.
Having seen quite some video's, I decided to review <a  href = " https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/portfolio_julian/ximpel_example.html">the one from group 13</a>.
And if I may be honest, I simply thought that this one was the best so far. <br>
Their video is about a guy who's grades have been lacking. So like any normal person, he decides to break into the university and steal
the answers to a test with the help of a hacker friend. Not only does this video look very professional, with good camerawork,
sound effects, music and a tension that is geniunely exciting, they also managed to make the choises interesting enough that you want to try
both of the choices they offer. I thought that their idea of two friends communicating through an earpiece and thereby having a voiceover in the video
is simply genius, and I liked the idea of portraying parts of the video as security camera's and thereby seeing what the security guard sees.
 Allthough there were some parts that could've been better, such as seeing the
cameraman or crew in the reflection or not knowing where in the building the main character was, I thought this was a great video. 9.5/10!
<br><br>
What I also noticed is that not a single video is like the other. One is a simple video on how to make pancakes or "pepernoten", the other is about a love story,
and the other one is a vlog from a guy who you can tell what he's gonna do. I also noticed that lots of people used the same tactic as we used: having the choices lead up to the same story again.
The choices did matter to the story, but eventually there was just one storyline. I really liked the variation when watching all these, and you cannot deny that all
the groups had a lot of creativity when making these films.

<b>My review. / 27 - 10 - 2021 </b><br>
For this weeks assignment, we had to visit and give comments on the website of a fellow student.
I had the honors of reviewing <a href="https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/johnz/">john's website</a>.
<br>The first thing that I noticed when opening his website, was the cool design: he has a
nice dark hexagonal background, with textboxes in the middle containing the text and pictures.
There is a navigation menu in the top-left corner, which enables you to easily switch between pages and
the style for the website is consistent for all pages. Although the pages did not contain a clear
text saying what page is show at that moment and the text in the boxes were rather 'crammed', I liked his website!<br>
When opening the source for the website, it showed a link to a CSS-sheet for the layout of
his website. This is good, since this means that all the pages with this link refer to this sheet. This would
also explain the consistency of style of the website.<br>
What I learned from reviewing johnz's website, is that there are lots of different styles of sites:
not only the colour palette is different, but his entire structure and way of showing his stuff is done
differently. This made me realise how much freedom you have and how many possibilities there are for a website.

<b>How I made my style. / 21-10-2021 </b><br>
In this blog post I'll explain some of the things that I used to give this website my own touch.<br><br>
First of all, the font. I simply thought it would be nice to have Comic Sans as a font, but when I went to the font
library of google (where we can copy links to a font and use it), I discovered that Comic Sans is owned by microsoft
and you had to pay for it. Not wanting to do that, I thought "Well, then I'll just use a common font and make it italic."
However, when I added the line "font-family: italic" to the stylesheet, it somehow turned all the text into Comic Sans.
I thought this was rather fun, so I kept it!<br> <br>
Next up, the colours. Being a fan of the colour blue, I wanted to make that the main colour of the website. So with help of
Google's RGB colour-picker, I selected a colour blue and copied the code for that. I then used a gradient to make the background,
so it has a smooth transition of blue in the left top corner to white in the bottom right corner.<br><br>
Thirdly, I gave the boxes at the top displaying the webpage and images some round edges and a blurry shadow. This was also done in the stylesheet.
I thought this would make it look a bit smoother and more 3D. <br><br>
At last, there is something I have not yet done for the style, but am planning to do in the future. Currently, the blog posts
and the portfolio files are simply stacked on top of each other on one webpage. I am planning on turning every post into some sort
of folder: the viewer can click on it and it will then expand or take them to a new webpage specifically for that post.

  <b>4. My review of someone's website. / 14-10-2021</b><br>
  For this excercise, I will review and give remarks on the website of my friend Blarkson.
  He created his website for this same assignment, and I think it is safe to say that it looks rather good.
  You can visit his site via <a href="https://portfolio.cr.utwente.nl/student/barkston/index.html">this link. </a> <br>

<table>
  <tr>
<th>Strong points of Barkston's website:</th>
<th>Weak points of Barkston's website:</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The website has a clear overview and it is easy to switch using the navigation menu.</td>
<td>The title at the top of the website make me dizzy when reading.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It is a happy website, by using the rainbow as a background.</td>
<td>His use of capital and lowercase letters are completely random. This makes it look not that professional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The website contains all the manditory excercises.</td>
<td>In his portfolio he put his E-mail, but this is not a link.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>His website has a nice picture of his dog.</td>
<td>The navigation menu shows which page you are on by highlighting that button. However, it highlights in yellow, while the letters are white, which is rather hard to read.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The code for his website is also very clear and ordered, and therefor rather readable and understandable.</td>
<td>The picture he posted with his second blog post does not fit in the box of the post.</td>
</tr>

<b>3. Our progress on the video project. / 13-10-2021</b> <br>
For Introduction to CreaTe, we were assigned to make an interactive video. This means that there are (at least 3) moments in the video when the viewer has to choose what is going to happen.
Last week we had to let our idea for the story be checked, and we got some new remarks. I personally was't really that satisfied with our idea so far: it was too serious and we made it too complicated for ourselves.
I think my group thought the same, so after the feedback we had a little meeting again to see if we could make it something actually good. <br>
What I have learned from my experience with making video's, is that you should never, <i>ever</i>, take it too serious.
So that is exactly what we did: we wrote down a story we simply though was fun, and packed with enthousiasm we went back to the coordinator (who was about to leave and had to hear us out about our
video). He had some remarks, but thought this one was indeed better. This friday we're having a free day, which we're gonna spend at one of our home to work out the story and script, which I'm kinda looking forward to!

  <b>2. The WebTech process. / 6-10-2021</b>
    <br>
As I am currently working on the code, I might as well inform you on the plans I have
for this website. The main idea was to create a home page with the title of the site at
the top. Underneath, there are a few buttons which will lead you to different webpages.
Currently, there are three: one to the main page, the blog and the portfolio. Whether there are going to be more buttons
 and what they will lead to
is still unknown, but that is something for the next excercise. I made a simple sketch of what I expect the
site to look like, which can be seen underneath this text. <br><br>

<b>1. My first experience at University. / 21-9-2021</b>
<br>
Being a student at this university has made me learn and
realise lots of things. First of all: the weekends are short. <i> Very short. </i> <br>
One moment I come home after a week of studying and getting used to student life, and before I know it I'm back on the train again heading for Enschede.
I do realy like it here though. My roommates are very
chill and I have a lot of fun in my student house.
I have also discovered the absoluty fantastic invention that is a microwave meal: currently I'm busy with testing all the different types of microwave-lasagne from the Lidl.
<br> <br> At university things are going quite well. Well, so far it's been going well. I'm pretty sure that we'll be living in a period of stress, assignments and homework very soon, so I'm trying to enjoy my chill time as long as I can.
The courses that we have, have also been pretty nice. So far the Video Project course has been my favorite: making video's is something I consider to be quite fun to do and I'm actually kind of excited to work on and learn about that.
