            <div class="portfolio-content">
                <p> The first assignment was to design and make sketches of tinkering "building blocks" – which, despite the name, don't technically have to be blocks).
I started by writing down some tinkering resources I already knew, followed by the reason why each one what made those such great building blocks. I thought that by writing down what made other resources great, I would be inspired to make something great as well! (It's the idea that counts...) <br><br>
The tinkering resources included LEGO, Knex, Temsi, and magnetic sticks and balls. Having written down for every single one why those were great examples of tinkering building blocks, I then felt like LEGO deserved a bit more, which is why I then filled another page just dedicated to LEGO. <br><br>

     The great thing about LEGO is that it is an entire system consisting of multiple techniques. There is the brick-based LEGO, which is not only simple to build with, but also enables you to make something that properly represents whatever you are building. A LEGO car looks like an actual car, a LEGO house looks like an actual house etc.
     There is also the technical side to LEGO, which makes use of sticks and is more suited for mechanical builds. LEGO Technic makes use of this type. <br><br>
     Thus, LEGO can be used for pretty much anything tinkering related. So now the question was: what can I come up with? <br><br>
     I sketched a bunch of concepts, all displayed underneath. Next to these sketches I added in keywords the core idea and the type of tinkering resource this concept was built upon. <br><br>

     <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; gap: 2rem;">

     <img src="img/Sketches2.JPG" style="height: 400px; object-fit: cover;" >
    </div>
 <br> <p>
  Developing these sketches made me realise something: <b>if you come up with something you think is an original idea, LEGO has already made it... </b><br><br>
  So while coming up with ideas was difficult for me, I did like the ideas of 3 and 5:
  Sketch 5 was based on a system of tubes and connection cylinders, while sketch 3 was based on using pencils. I thought: everyone has pencils, why not use them for something else than just drawing? <br><br>
  So I imagined a system that uses pencils as sticks and has little connection-parts that they can snap or be plugged into. These connection parts could have all sorts of shapes, allowing for the connection of pencils at all sorts of angles. This system would then allow for the creation of all sorts of geometric structures. <br><br>

            <h2>session 2 - hands on</h2>
            <div class="portfolio-content">
              <p>After making a bunch of sketches last week, this week I started on building one of those building blocks. I decided to work out the pencil connection part tube thingie, so I opened up Blender, made a cylinder, gave it the right dimensions for a pencil, imported it into Cura and let my 3D printer make a rough prototype. As expected, the first tube did not fit, so I adjusted the model and printed it again. This tube was too big and the pencil would not stay in place. After some tweaking I got the right dimensions. Since printing one tube only took around 10 minutes, I let it print a bunch of them. <br>Of course, the first thing I did when I had a lot of tubes was to connect all my pencils and make one long pencil wand stick with it. <br><br>
        <img src="img/wand.JPG" alt="avada kedavra" width=30%>
        <br><br>The errors in dimensions did raise the following idea: what if I made tubes of multiple sizes? One tube (colored red for instance) would fit the pencils so that they stay in place, and another tube (colored blue for instance) would be slightly bigger so that the tubes can rotate and is not fixed. <br><br>
<img src="img/StukkieWukkie.jpg" alt="sacrifices must be made..." width="40%"><br><br>
However, before I started working on that idea, I wanted to properly develop the cornerpieces. I first made a simple 90 degrees cornerpiece, but the thought: this should actually be an X-shaped cornerpiece. And if an X-shaped cornerpiece was not enough, I thought to myself: why don’t I develop a cornerpiece with sticks pointing in both the x, y and z directions. So I did. And granted, the first one was too big and I accidentally snapped one piece when trying ot remove its support, but that was nothing that a bit of glue and filing couldn’t solve. <br><br>

After letting my 3D printer work for a full afternoon making these pieces, I ended up with a whole bunch of parts and allowed myself a fun session of playing with these parts. I managed to make a little catapult, which was probably the highlight of my day.

        <h2>session 3 - coding metaphor</h2>
        <div class="portfolio-content">
          <p>
            For this week’s exercise, we had to come up with a metaphor for coding. Since it has been a while since I have programmed something (and I have forgotten most of my coding-skills), I decided to stick to the primitive coding principles. The first idea I had was about how a program such as in Processing simply constantly loops certain functions. Since I mainly remember loops and if-statements, I decided to think of a metaphor that implements those two ideas. Thus, I came up with a coding game metaphor. <br><br>
            The inspiration behind this was a game we play at scouting, called Mijnenveld (or Landmines). The objective is to get across a chess-like raster field. However, there are landmines scattered across the field, of which the players do now know the location. The player can thus take a step (forward, left, right or backwards) and, dependent on whether there was a landmine there, they can stay on that tile or explode. If they explode, they get back in line and the next player is allowed to go. The players are supposed to memorise where the landmines are placed and what the safe path is to get across. <br><br>

  <img src="img/bearSketch.jpg" width=50%><br><br>

            My game was based on such a thing: in a chess-like field made of tiles, the player has to get across. But there are obstacles in the field! So the player has to program a certain code to get across that the avatar will follow. <br><br>
            In the field there might for instance be a bush. If the player encounters a bush, they have to go around it. So the player can use an if-statement to check if there is a bush, and if so turn 90 degrees. <br><br>

            People can very easily make their own things, and follow the code for step by step (for instance by pointing a pencil at what step they are now). This also teaches them the principle that a computer program simply does what you tell it to, and does not think for itself. <br>            <div class="row">
