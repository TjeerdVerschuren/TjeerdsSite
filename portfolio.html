                <p>For this module's project, my group and I tackled the issue of the declining bee population. For one of the deliverables, we had to make a lo-fi prototype of
our product. This included a visualisation of a bee hotel, which I made in blender. The wooden textures were rendered by sticking pictures of pieces of wood
on meshes, and I am rather satisfied with the end result!</p>

                <p>For the final project of Module 5, we had to make a simple video-game. Me and my friend worked together on our game called Ducks 'n Explosions.
The game's objective is to rescue a duck who got stuck inside a school and get him outside safely. However, the only means of interacting with
the game is by throwing bombs and creating explosions, from which the duck will run away. We divided the task in two parts: the design and the technical
part. I worked on the design part, which includes making all objects and characters in blender, importing and putting them together in Unity and creating the
sound-effects and music. you can <a href="https://marro.dev/post/ducks-n-explosions">play the game here!</a> </p>

                <p><b>Date:</b> 1 - 4 - 2022</p>
                <p>This module we had the course Interactive Visualisation. We did this
by following some lectures and by doing the weekly assignments. These showed you the basic knowledge that you needed to work with these
programs. For the final assignment, you had to make an object in Blender, where you would be graded on how well you met the
the needed requirements. I decided to make a pocketwatch as my final project, since I though this would be interesting and challenging. I had
an advantage that I already had some Blender experience from the previous module's ProfDev challenge. I looked up lots and lots of pictures
of pocketwatches and watched video's on how they technically worked, and manage to make a design that in a way contains some certain aspects
of a real working pocketwatch. For the materials I looked up online how to make those, and since Blender has a big community, there is always a tutorial
that explains exactly what you're looking for. The TA's were (if I may say so) quite astonished by my final product: especially the detail and the
modelling were remarkable according to them. I was rather happy with a 9/10 for my final result!  </p>

                <p>For this module's challenge for ProfDev, I wanted to discover more aspects of filmmaking. I already have some skills concerning editing
and preparation of filmmaking, but I had zero experience with the actual filming. So I followed the two workshops by SolidFocus on Videography
and Entrepreneurship. During the first workshop we learned about all sort of things, including how to work with a camera, lighting, voice-overs and
more. I wanted to do something with this knowledge that I had gained, so I decided to make a showcase-video. Firstly, I wanted to make one of our
project's prototype, where we could talk about what we made and show how it works. The only problem with this was that the prototype would not be finished
before the ProfDev presentation, so there would be no product to make a video about. I then decided to make a showcase video about my bike. I made it in
the style of one of those advertising video's for a new phone or car, like it is a completely new product/invention. With a camera and pop-filter I borrowed and the
newly gained knowledge, I made something quite ridiculous but fun. The end result is shown below.  </p>

                <p>For this module's Professional Development challenge, we had to dive into a topic that we thought to be interesting. I decided to take a look
into the world that is Blender. Blender is a computer graphics software that people can use for the visualisation of all sorts of
things: it can be used to make realisticly looking artificial images, animation, games, virtual reality etc. I followed a YouTube tutorial
by Blender Guru, consisting of 16 video's in which he shows the different tools that Blender provides. During this tutorial he'll show how
to use those tools to create a realisticly looking Donut. Since Blender is a rather extensive program, the possibilities are limitless and
you can experience with it all you want. Since it is almost impossible to learn every bit of Blender, this would also be the way to become
good at it: by getting familiar with the program. </p>

            <h2>Programming: The creature</h2>
            <div class="portfolio-content">
                <p><b>Date:</b> 6-10-2021</p>
                <p>For programming we're currently working on creating "a creature". This can be any
  type of thing: a penguin, a snail, a collection of hedgehogs, or as in my case:
  a green blobby monster.
  I have created something which I am quite proud of: You see a landscape, and after a while
  a (shy) green blobby creature comes out of the grass. I am planning on adding more: there is going
  to be a pile of fruit next to him, which you can drag. As a reaction, Blob will open
  his mouth, and you'll be able to feed him.
  However, I have come to the conclusion that programming can be very confusing.
  This sunday I have to hand in the end result of the creature, and I have been struggling very much
  to get where I am right now, and I don't consider it to be a good enough program yet... However, some people
  have told me that it looks nice and that Blob is pretty cute, which gives me motivation to work on it.</p>

                        <p> I am a big fan of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, and some time ago I thought it would be cool to
          have a ring of my own. So I made one of a nut I found in the shed. I started with filing it to
          make it more round, and gave it a shiny surface using very smooth sandpaper. The nut was
          made out of stainless steel and very tough; this project took me around 20 hours to finish.</p>
