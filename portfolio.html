                <p> Our assignment was to design and make sketches of tinkering "building blocks" (that don't technically have to be blocks).
                  Of course, LEGO is a genius and great building block. The first thing I did was write down some tinkering resources, and what made them good!
                  These tinkering resources included LEGO, Knex, Temsi and magnetic sticks and balls. I then filled another page just dedicated to why LEGO is so great (of which I can probably fill many more pages).
                  Since my handwriting is terrible, I'll give a quick explanation on everything underneath. <br><br>

     </div> <p>
     <br><br>
The great thing about LEGO is that it is an entire system of multiple techniques. There is the brick-based LEGO, which is not only simple to build with, but also enables you to
make something that properly represents whatever you are building. A LEGO car actually looks like a car, a LEGO house actually looks like a house etc. <br>There is also the technical side to LEGO,
which makes use of sticks and are more suited for mechanical builds. LEGO Technic makes use of this type.
<br><br>
Thus, LEGO can be used for pretty much anything tinkering related. So now the question was: what can I come up with? <br><br>

I made a bunch of sketches, all displayed underneath. Next to these sketches I wrote in keywords what this type of tinkering resource was build upon. </p>

</div>
</div> <br> <p>
Developing these sketches made me realise something: if you come up with what you think is an original idea, LEGO has already made it...
<br> So while coming up with ideas was difficult for me, I did like the ideas of 3 and 5: sketch 5 was based on a system of tubes and connection cyclinders, while sketch 3 was
based on using pencils. I thought: everyone has pencils, why not use them for something else than just drawing? So I thouhgt of a system that uses pencils as sticks, and has little
conncetion-parts that they can be plugged into.

                <p>I'm a big fan of The Lord of the Rings, and one day wanted to make a ring myself. So I got a nut in the shed, some sanding paper, files and metal saws and got working. Making the ring took around 20 hours, and I still wear it to this day.
