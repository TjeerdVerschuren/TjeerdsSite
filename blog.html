      <h2>personal information</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a student at the University of Twente, currently 21 years old and also work at the DesignLab as a DreamTeamer (and maybe soon-to-be as a TechTeamer as well)! My hobbies include playing the guitar, being a scout's leader and mess around with all sorts of creative projects!
<br><br>
After finishing my bachelor's Creative Technology, I'd like to do the master's Educatie in de Bètawetenschappen to become a teacher in Research and Design (O&O in Dutch).

      <h2>my tinkering experience</h2>
        <p>
          I like working on all sorts of creative projects, for instance with wood, metal, plastic etc. The workspaces I colonise most are my dad's shed at home, or the workshops in the DesignLab. I'm also the proud owner of a 3D printer in my student room since a few weeks, which I am still learning how to use and has been working non-stop ever since I got it! <br><br>
  My dad's shed is mainly for woodworking. Being provided with all the material and tools I need, I can mess around and make all sorts of projects. Some of the time not with a clear idea or goal, sometimes with a fully worked out plan – which I often ignore once the building begins. Most projects I do in there start with an idea of what I want, followed by a very rough sketch for a design. I then open all the cabinets and drawers and gather all materials I think might be useful for this project. Then, I “mess around” with these materials and develop a prototype. <br><br>
  The other tinkering workspace I find myself at a lot of time are the workshops in the DesignLab, especially since I work there as a DreamTeamer and have access to the workshops during after-hours as well. While I am familiar with most of the tools and machines there (and frequently use them), I have to say that the laser cutter might me my favourite tool there. It is fast, precise and perfect for making both quick iterations or prototypes (for instance with cardboard) or actual good-looking products with wood or plastic. <br>

While my dad’s shed has more materials and random bits laying around that encourage creativity and spontaneous tinkering, the DesignLab provides more advanced tools and machines which are great for prototyping in their own way. My ideal tinkerspace would be a combination of the two: a space with a lot of materials and scraps that spark creativity and new ideas as well as equipped with the tools to quickly turn ideas into prototypes, for instance with a 3D-printer and laser cutter. <br><br>
