      <h2>personal information</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a student at the University of Twente, currently 21 years old and also work at the DesignLab as a DreamTeamer! My hobbies include playing the guitar, being a scout's leader and mess around with all sorts of creative projects!
            <br><br>
            After finishing my bachelor's Creative Technology, I'd like to do the master's Educatie in de BÃ¨tawetenschappen to become a teacher in Research and Design (O&O in Dutch).

      <h2>my tinkering experience</h2>
        <p>
          I like working on all sorts of creative projects, for instance with wood, metal, plastic etc. The workspaces I colonise most are my dad's shed at home, or the workshops in the DesignLab.
          I'm also the proud owner of a 3D printer in my student room since a few weeks, which I am still learning how to use and has been working non-stop ever since I got it!
          <br><br>
          My dad's shed is mainly for woodworking. Being provided with all the material and tools I need, I can mess around and make all sorts of projects. Some of the time not with a clear
          idea or goal, sometimes with a fully worked out plan (to then be completely ignored when building).
            </p>
